Want to have more versions of MineKhan ready-to-play without internet, but they aren't in the Launcher? Good news for you! The MineKhan Launcher is pre-set up for adding in other files! Read below for instructions.

Open up [PARENT FOLDER HERE]\MineKhanLauncherV3\Menus\MKM\MKM.html in notepad. Go to lines 97-98 of the file and remove the "<!--" and "-->" symbols at the beginning and end of line 98. Save the file. After you've added the link, go to [PARENT FOLDER HERE]\MineKhanLauncherV3\Menus\MKM\User-added\Template.html in notepad. Replace the contents of this file with an HTML MineKhan version, save, change the name, and go back to the MKM.html file. Change the address in the code to the new address and change the title of the link. Save the file and run the Launcher, and it should appear on the MineKhan: JavaScript Edition version list. To add more, read the following steps. If you are getting it off of Khan Academny, save the HTML code as a .html and then copy & paste line 98 of MKM.html. However, if you are using KhanForge, you can skip the file-saving and simply download the HTML file (you'll still need to copy+paste line 98).
