	NOTE:
The "Save" button saves your world to your local browser. Nobody else can s=
ee it. However, if you're on a public or shared computer, that save may be =
deleted unexpectedly. So it's a good idea to keep a safe copy of your save =
string somewhere where it won't be deleted.

To share your save with other people, copy your world string into the "load=
String" variable on line 189.

	Notes and accreditation:
 * This program (MineKhan) was made by Willard (me). The original is https:=
//www.khanacademy.org/cs/mc/5647155001376768 (just adding this so that spin=
-offs have it)
 * Zushah helped me with some of the menus in the 0.6 update via GitHub. ht=
tps://www.khanacademy.org/profile/zushah77
 * Element118 helped speed up the process of adding new textures significan=
tly. https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/element118
 * Danielkshin made the current main menu background. https://www.khanacade=
my.org/profile/danielkshin

 * This program originated as a spin-off of ScusCraft by ScusX.
 * It's 99% different code at this point, but I still never would have made=
 it this far without his code for reference.
 * ScusCraft can be found here: https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-progra=
mming/scuscraft-3d/5145400332058624
 * My original spin-off can be found here: https://www.khanacademy.org/comp=
uter-programming/high-performance-minecraft/5330738124357632
 * While porting the code from PJS to a webpage, I copied the PJS source co=
de for a few of their helper functions from here: https://raw.githubusercon=
tent.com/Khan/processing-js/master/processing.js
 * The textures are 100% copied from real Minecraft, and are the property o=
f Mojang and Microsoft with whom I have no association.
 * The real Minecraft game can be bought and downloaded at https://www.mine=
craft.net/en-us/


 * Chunks are kept in memory until you restart. So don't explore too far or=
 memory usage will grow until it crashes unrecoverably.


	To-Do:
 * A lot. Check out the GitHub repo if you'd like to collaborate on this. M=
ust use Discord.

	How it works:

The graphics in this project are done using WebGL, which is a web implement=
ation of OpenGL ES 2.
It allows us to write shader programs that run right on the GPU, which mean=
s it can run as fast as any C++ game.
The infamous P3D mode in Processing.js uses WebGL behind the scenes, but it=
 does it so inefficiently that it might as well not even being using the GP=
U.

To properly utilize WebGL like this program does, you need to make efficien=
t use of Vertext Buffer Objects (VBOs).
A VBO is an array that contains a whole bunch of vertices. Since WebGL can =
only render triangles and lines, these vertices are stored in multiples of =
3.
A vertex doesn't only include its world coordinates, though. It also includ=
es its texture coordinates, and any other data you want the shaders to mani=
pulate.
In my case, every vertex has an X, Y, Z, textureX, textureY, and shadowInte=
nsity. So 6 values for every block vertex in the world.

A program can only draw 1 VBO per draw call. Since the texture data is atta=
ched to the vertex data, you can't switch textures between vertices.
That means you either have to make seperate draw calls for each texture, or=
 only use 1 texture. I do the latter.
I make a single 256x256 pixel texture, and store each of the 16x16 block te=
xtures in a section of that big texture, and store the coordinates to it. T=
his is informally called a "texture atlas".
Then when I'm preparing my VBO, I send the texture coordinates along with t=
he block coordinates so the shader knows how to map the 256x256 pixel textu=
re onto the 16x16 pixel block face.

I do this once for each chunk in the world, and store those VBOs so I can d=
raw them every frame. If a block is edited in a chunk, then that VBO is rep=
laced.
Drawing a chunk after the VBO has been created is as simple as binding the =
buffer and calling "gl.drawArrays" once per chunk. The GPU takes care of th=
e rest.

I also use what's called Vertex Array Objects (VAOs) to re-use shared verti=
ces. Since the GPU expects triangles, and I want to draw squares, I need to=
 draw 2 triangles (6 vertices) per square.
That means 2 of them are being re-used. The VAO lets me tell the GPU to use=
 the cached vertex data instead of looking for a new one, which offers a sm=
all inprovement to GPU performance.
This isn't entirely necessary, but it's considered best practice. Some Open=
GL ES implementations require it, but WebGL 1 does not. I think WebGL 2 doe=
s, but that's not as well supported.
