Want to have more versions of MineKhan ready-to-play without internet, but they aren't in the Launcher? Good news for you! The MineKhan Launcher is pre-set up for adding in those other files! Read below for instructions.

Download the mod off of KhanForge or copy and paste off of Khan Academy into Template.html. Open up [PARENT FOLDER HERE]\MineKhanLauncherV4\Menus\MKM\MKM.html in notepad. Go to line 109 of MKM.html. Rename the name that displays in the drop-down menu to the name of the mod. Also change the link refference. Save the file and run the Launcher, and it should appear on the MineKhan mod list. To add more, read the following steps. If you are getting it off of Khan Academy, save the HTML code as a .html and then copy line 109 of MKM.html. Hit enter (return if on Mac), paste it, rename the title + link, and then hit save. However, if you are using KhanForge, you can and simply download the HTML file (you'll still need to copy+paste line 109).
